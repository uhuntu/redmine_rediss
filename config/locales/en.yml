  text_stemming_info: "This controls how the query parser will apply the stemming algorithm. The default value is
    STEM_NONE. The possible values are: STEM_NONE -  Don't perform any stemming, STEM_SOME - Search for stemmed forms
    of terms except for those which start with a capital letter, or are followed by certain characters
    (currently:'/@<>=*[{\"'), or are used with operators which need positional information. Stemmed terms are prefixed
    with 'Z', STEM_ALL - Search for stemmed forms of all words (note: no 'Z' prefix is added)."
  text_stemming_note: Note that the stemming algorithm is only applied to words in probabilistic fields -
    boolean filter terms are never stemmed.

    option needs to have been used at index time.
